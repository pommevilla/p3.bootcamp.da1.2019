According to the first-order difference criterion, the optimal clustering similarity was 98%. However, for various reasons (mostly due to physical limitations), we ended up choosing a 95% similarity threshold. 

After determining this, we then used the representative sequences found in `0.95.fa` and queried them against our metagenomes. Thus, for each metagenome, we had an output file containing all the relevant hits. We then used a Python script to summarize the abundance and presence of each these representative sequences across our metagenomes. This information can be found in `data/abundance_presence.tsv`

## Determine which clusters to include
